### **_Overview_**

#### This is my Unit 2 project where I built a functioning MERN (Mongoose/Express/React/Node) full-stack application. The idea for this project came from my younger brother who was having trouble finding friends with similar hobbies/interests. In this application, users can create a profile that lists their hobbies/interests and location to connect with each other to make friends and build a communtiy.

### **_Getting Started_**

- To start on this project, I will build out the backend (creating models/data) and make sure that I can retrieve the correct data with the correlating routes.
- From there, I will create my React app with a `HomePage`, `AboutPage`, `ProfilePage`, and a `FriendPage` where users will be able to search for people with similar hobbies.
- After the pages are created, I will build out the necessary components such as the `Newsfeed` where `Posts` from other users will be shown, an `Info` component that will layout a user's own personal information, and a `Person` component that will populate a user's search when looking for friends.
